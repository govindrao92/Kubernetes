In Kubernetes, deployment is an object that defines the desired state for a group of containers.

It provides a declarative way to create and manage instances of applications.

A deployment specifies the container image to be used, the number of replicas of the application to be created, and the resources required by each replica.

It also defines how the updates to the application should be rolled out, whether it should be done in a rolling or rolling-update strategy, and how many simultaneous updates should be allowed.

By using a deployment, Kubernetes ensures that the desired state of the application is maintained, continuously monitoring for any changes and taking necessary actions to reconcile the current state with the desired state. It enables easy scalability, rolling updates, and automatic rollbacks in case of failures.

Deployments are typically accessed using the Kubernetes API, but can also be managed using command-line tools like kubectl.
